# PokedexAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Services

The restServices folder contains the backend of the application, in turn the backend was developed with CodeIgniter.

The restServices folder should be placed outside the pokedex-angular folder, just in the root of the server, due to internal problems with my xampp server the port used for the services is port 8080.
